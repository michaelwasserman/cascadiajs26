## Abstract: 
AX, Agent Experience
Building products for agents

## Community talk notes:

### Chapter I
Netlify objective - Turn imagination into reality
Discussion of how JavaScript is one of the languages that help create the magic of the web.

Progression breakdown of AI assistance and agents within driving vehicles, to having AI autonomy.

"""The whole stack changes when the driver is no longer human"""
Timelapse of autocomplete within the IDE to building with an AI agent to describe ideas and supervise the development to using AI assistance. Shifting the "build vs buy" equation.

We will see a lot of shift happening in how things are developed.
Referencing OpenClaw.ai, autonomous coding agents, and making the comparison to self-driving cars.
While autonomous cars make us rethink cities, autonomous agents make us rethink our platforms, virtual cities, products and more.

### Chapter II - Agent Experience
Today - AX is critical for infra and dev tools
Tomorrow: your products wont' succeed without it

Before UX (User Experience) was coined by Don Norman, the interaction with the UI was not seen as an experience.
DX - Developer Experience coined by Jeremiah Lee Cohick
AX - Agent Experience
Covering the experience that agents will have as they work with a product or platform.

### How to AX?
It's about understanding how agents experience your product.

*Four pillars:*
1. Access
- Can the agent access your product?
- Does your agent have the correct permissions?
For Netlify, they've added netlify.ai that provides two different experiences for humans vs bots. For bots, markdown files are provided instead of the marketing website.
Agent Auth is an emerging standards to facilitate access to different products. 
2. Context
- Does the LLM know about your product?
Provide docs as context. Shipping a Markdown variant of every page is cheaper to read, easier to parse and friendlier to LLM context windows.
Model Context Protocol (MCP) - Focusing on context to expose what your product knows in an universal format as UI for LLMs.
API vs MCP - Same product, different surfaces
3. Tools
- Are you building your product for agents?

Every product has an Agent Experience, but is it good?
A good developer experience doesn't necessarily mean a good agent experience.
For Netlify CLI, by adding a response that indicates how to use the product without interaction, AX improves by providing an alternative route.

4. Orchestration
Agents are launchable from your product
Working in AI-native environments to allow aysnc agents to work autonomously.

### The Road Ahead
"""As agents become autonomous and our whole team become builders, we need to reshape every part of our developer platforms"""
Netlify provided Axis, an open-source framework developed to rate the agent experience.
